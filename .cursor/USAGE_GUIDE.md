# Persistent Instruction Context System - Usage Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start for AI Assistants

### At the Start of Each Session
```
1. Read .cursor/instruction_context.md (full context)
   OR
   Read .cursor/context_summary.txt (quick reference)

2. Reference the context while coding
3. Update after learning new patterns
```

### Example Workflow
```
User: "Add a new 'comments' feature to documents"

AI:
1. ‚úÖ Read instruction_context.md
2. ‚úÖ Follow service layer pattern: models ‚Üí schemas ‚Üí exceptions ‚Üí services ‚Üí api
3. ‚úÖ Add permission checks in services
4. ‚úÖ Use SWR for frontend data fetching
5. ‚úÖ Update context with any new patterns discovered
```

## üìã For Human Developers

### When to Update Context Files

**Update `instruction_context.md` when:**
- Adding new architectural patterns
- Establishing new coding conventions
- Introducing new dependencies or frameworks
- Making style or design decisions
- Identifying technical debt or known issues
- Completing major features

**Example Update:**
```markdown
## Changelog

### 2025-10-06 - Comments Feature
- Added Comment model with nested replies pattern
- Established real-time updates using WebSockets
- Updated service layer to handle comment threads
```

### Working with AI Assistants

**Tell the AI to:**
```
"Follow the patterns in .cursor/instruction_context.md"
"Update the context file with the new pattern we just established"
"Check the vibe rules before generating this component"
```

**Review AI Updates:**
- AI may update context after learning new patterns
- Review these updates in PRs like any other code change
- Ensure updates align with team conventions

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Review recent PRs for new patterns not yet documented
- [ ] Check if context file aligns with actual codebase

### Monthly
- [ ] Perform context drift audit
- [ ] Update "Current State" section
- [ ] Review and consolidate changelog

### When Onboarding New Team Members
- [ ] Share `.cursor/instruction_context.md` as project guide
- [ ] Explain the AI context system
- [ ] Demonstrate how to request AI follow patterns

  - Impact: [What's affected]
  - Reason: [Why it exists]
  - Future plan: [How to address]
```

### Recording Major Changes

## üí° Advanced Techniques

### Context Scoping
For large codebases, create sub-context files:
```
.cursor/
  instruction_context.md       # Main context
  context_backend.md           # Backend-specific patterns
  context_frontend.md          # Frontend-specific patterns
  context_ai_features.md       # AI module patterns
```

### AI Prompts Library
Add common prompts to context:
```markdown
## AI Prompt Templates

### Adding CRUD Feature
"Create a new [entity] feature following the DocAI service pattern.
Include: models, schemas, exceptions, services, API routes, and frontend components."

### Debugging Permission Issues
"Check permission flow in [feature]. Verify checks exist in service layer,
not API routes. Follow the Doc/DocUser permission pattern."
```

### Context Validation
Create a script to validate context:
```bash
# Check if documented patterns exist in codebase
# Flag deviations from style guide
# Generate drift report
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Should we commit these files?**  
A: Yes! These are living documentation and team knowledge.

**Q: What if AI updates get out of hand?**  
A: Review AI updates in PRs. Treat context files like code.

**Q: How detailed should updates be?**  
A: Document patterns, not every code change. Focus on "how we do things."

**Q: Can we have multiple context files?**  
A: Yes, for large projects consider splitting by domain.

**Q: How do we handle conflicts?**  
A: Resolve like any merge conflict. Favor recent team decisions.

## üé® Example AI Session

```
# Session Start
AI: *Reads instruction_context.md*
AI: Ready to code DocAI following established patterns.

User: Add a tag system for documents

AI: I'll follow the service layer pattern:
1. Create Tag model with many-to-many to Doc
2. Create TagSchema (Pydantic)
3. Add tag_services.py with business logic
4. Add tag API routes with user_required auth
5. Add frontend components using SWR
6. Update context with tag patterns

*After implementation*

AI: I've added the tag feature. I'll now update instruction_context.md
to document the many-to-many pattern we used...

# Context Updated
Section: Core Architecture
Added: Tag system using Django M2M with through model
```

**Remember:** This system works best when both humans and AI actively maintain it. Treat these files as your project's "memory" - keep them accurate, evolve them thoughtfully, and reference them often.
